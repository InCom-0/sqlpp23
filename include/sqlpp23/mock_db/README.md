# Mock Database

The mock database has two purposes:

## Unit tests

Unit tests are the primary use case for `mock_db`. See (/tests/core)[/tests/core].


## Template for new connector libraries

`mock_db` has the same API as other database connectors. It should get you started if and when you want to write a new connector to a database backend.
