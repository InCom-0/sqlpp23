# New data types

## optional
Nullable values are represented as `std::optional` if you are using C++17 or later, `sqlpp::compat::optional` otherwise.

## string_view
Text results are represented as `std::string_view` if you are using C++17 or later, `sqlpp::compat::string_view` otherwise.

# span<uint8_t>
Blob results are represented as `std::span<uint8_t>` if you are using C++20 or later, `sqlpp::compat::span<uint8_t>` otherwise.

# Result values
Result rows are represented as structs with the respective columns represented as data members. In version 1.0, these data members used to have a type that wrapped the actual data and provided conversion operators and functions to check for NULL.

Now data members have the correct data type, e.g. `int64_t` or `optional<string_view>`.

# No read-only columns
Version 1.0 had the concept of read-only columns, e.g. you could not modify a column with auto-increment values.

This concept has been removed. In most cases, you will still not want to modify columns with auto-increment values, but you can do it now, if you want to.

# IS DISCTINCT FROM
Version 1.0 used to have `is_equal_to_or_null` which translated to either `=` or `IS NULL`. While useful, this did not work with parameters.

The library now offers `is_distinct_from` and `is_not_distinct_from` which safely compares with actual values and `NULL`.

# Selecting aggregate functions
The automatic name for selected aggregate functions drops the `_`.

# Aggregates and non-aggregates
They must not be mixed in a select.

`group_by` accepts columns only (there is an escape hatch: `group_by_column`)
`select` requires either
- all selected columns are aggregate expressions (either an aggregate function or a group by column), or
- no selected column is an aggregate expression

If group_by is specified in the select, then all columns have to be aggregate expressions.

# Join
unconditional joins are cross joins. The "unconditional" function is dropped.
Added join tables (other than the left-most) can be dynamic.

# Dynamic queries
We don't always have a completely fixed structure for our queries. For instance, there might columns that we only want to select under certain circumstances. In version 1.0, this was handled by dynamic queries. Now we introduce conditional query parts that may or may not be used at runtime:

## Select optional columns
select(tab.id, dynamic(condition, tab.bigData)).from(tab).where(tab.id == 17);

If `condition == true` then `bigData` will be selected, otherwise `NULL` will be selected.

## Join optional table
select(tabA.id).from(tabA.cross_join(dynamic(condition, tabB))).where(tab.id == 17);

If `condition == true` then the cross join will be part of the query, otherwise not. Obviously, that means that you need to make sure that query parts that rely on `tabB` in this example also depend on the same condition.

## Optional AND operand
select(tab.id).from(tab).where(tab.id == 17 and dynamic(condition, tab.desert != "cheesecake"));

If `condition == true`, then the dynamic part will evaluate to `tab.desert != "cheesecake")`. Otherwise it will be treated as `true` (and the AND expression will be collapsed).

## Optional OR operand
select(tab.id).from(tab).where(tab.id == 17 or dynamic(condition, tab.desert != "cheesecake"));

If `condition == true`, then the dynamic part will evaluate to `tab.desert != "cheesecake")`. Otherwise it will be treated as `false` (and the OR expression will be collapsed).

## CTE
cte.join is now allowed.

## DELETE FROM
This used to be called `remove_from` in 1.0, it has been renamed to `delete_from` to be closer to SQL.

## Dropped features
Unary operator+()

## Limit and offset
These accept integral values (not just unsigned integral)

## select_as
select_ref_t is not fully type safe (but should offer reasonable protection).
The reason for this is to reduce the sheer size of the serialized type, e.g. in error messages.

## cte_ref and friends
Not new, but also not documented before: Need to document that you need to be a bit careful with aliased CTEs as we use cte_ref in columns, from, and join.

## Dropped `eval`
eval(db, expr) was a wrapper returning `db(select(expr.as(a))).front().a`. With text and blob now being references, eval could now return dangling references.\
It seems much clearer for folks to just call db(select(something)) themselves...

## Dropped value_list
Now you can just do `tab.id.in(std::vector<int>{1, 2, 3, 4})`

## Dropped `some`
`some` is the same as `any`. Just use `any`.

## Introduced declare_group_by_column

## Dynamic columns in group by are considered known aggregate columns
This is just too unnerving (consider `select((5 + tab.id).as(something))....group_by(dynamic(cond, tab.id))`, or combinations with dynamic in the select column).

## Custom query is now expressed with statement_t::operator<<
This also means that custom queries now use the LAST return-value-clause (just like any other statement)

## statement_t.as() yields a table, not a value

## sqlite3: No magic conversion of uint64_t to int64_t during serialization.
Magic is dangerous, e.g. when used in comparison.

## order_by/group_by will be omitted if all args are dynamically dropped

## Note that in a sub select that is used as a value, we don't detect if a table is statically required but dynamically provided. This is because we do not have the full picture: The sub select could use tables from the enclosing query.

## unconditionally() has been replaced with where(true)

## dropped ppgn (cannot support it)

## Added truncate

## on_conflict().do_update() requires explicit where().
This is consistent with other statements: select, update, delete_from
